# Exercise: Give UI/UX Design Feedback

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Communicate feedback effectively with designers on your team. |
| Tools/Material | Something a designer on your team designed |
| Duration | 1-2 hours |


## Steps

1. Work with your mentor to get access to a recent design deliverable from a designer on your team. 
2. Look over the deliverable and take notes on feedback for them. Feedback can include: 
    - Calling out areas of potential technical difficulties. For example: "that scroll animation is too intensive, and might slow down the user's device," or "we don't have the data in place to do that."
    - Callout potentially confusing areas for the user. 
    - Feel free to give visual feedback, too, for example; "I think it would look cool if we put the text on the left, and the details on the right." 
    - Feel free to make any suggestions for improvements. 
    - Call out areas that you need more clarification on. For example: "Are you using our existing dropdown component, or is that intended to be a new component?"
    - Don't forget to tell them what you like and what they did well on!
3. Be sure to support your callouts with explanation and *seek understanding when necessary*. Remember, your designers didn't design something to be intentionally difficult; they had a good reason for it. Try to understand why they did something if you disagree, especially before making suggestions. For example: "I saw you used a button style that isn't in the design system, why was that?" - maybe they didn't realize there was an existing component, or perhaps they have a good reason for using a custom button. 
4. Another good tip to remember when putting together feedback is to think about what you would need to change or know to build this and call that out. 
5. Once you've got your feedback together, grab your mentor and discuss! 
6. Work with your mentor to get some time with the designer and give your feedback.

## Reflection

Use the following questions to reflect on what you learned with this exercise:

- Was the feedback well thought out and clear?
- Was the apprentice respectfully delivering the feedback?
- Did they use the proper terms when giving feedback? For instance, they provided input on a select dropdown but called it a text box instead. Or did they give feedback on the UI but call it out as a problem with the UX.
- Did the designer understand the feedback?
    - Did the apprentice seek proper understanding before making suggestions?
    - Was feedback delivered respectfully?
- What conclusion can you share with your mentor?
- What surprised you about this exercise?
- Where do you want to go from here?
