# Exercise: Configuring TLS/SSL

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Configure a backend service to use a TLS/SSL certificate |
| Duration | 2-4 hours |


## Steps

Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your best judgment, these are not precise steps):

1. Determine the backend service you're going to configure TLS/SSL for (e.g., a load balancer for a Kubernetes cluster)
2. Setup up TLS/SSL certificate for the target service
3. Ensure network traffic is properly routing through an HTTPS connection
4. Share your results with your mentor!

## Questions

Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

- What is the difference between TLS and SSL?
- What is a load balancer?
- How can you inspect network traffic in the cloud?
- How might you force HTTPS connections?
