# Exercise: Login Screen with Material Design

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Use a design system to create an interface. |
| Tools/Material | TextEditor, [Material Design Components](https://material.io/components?platform=web) |
| Duration | 2-3 hours |


## Steps

1. Open your text editor, and start a basic web project using your preferred web technologies. If you need extra help getting a web project started using Google's Material design, check out their getting started page [here](https://material.io/develop/web/getting-started).
2. Create a login page for your project.
3. Using Material Design import and use these components to build the mockup below:
    - [Text input](https://material.io/components/text-fields)
    - [Buttons](https://material.io/components/buttons)<img width="1440" src="login-wireframe.png">
4. Read the documentation and use the components correctly.
5. Once you're done creating the UI, feel free to style it or make it your own using [Material's theming capabilities](https://material.io/develop/web/theming/theming-guide). Try playing with color or shape!
6. Once you're done, grab your mentor and discuss!
