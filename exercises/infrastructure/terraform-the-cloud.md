# Exercise: Terraform the Cloud

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Setup a Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean using Terraform (don't forget to tear it down!) |
| Duration | 3-4 hours |

Make sure you have Terraform downloaded and installed on your machine and a DigitalOcean account created before you get started. It is also important to remember to tear down cloud resources you don't intend to keep around -- you don't want to get an unnecessary bill!

## Steps

Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your best judgment, these are not precise steps):

1. Sign in to your [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) account
2. Create a Kubernetes cluster manually on DigitalOcean and deploy a Dockerized API to it
3. Replicate the cluster configuration using Terraform
4. Using Terraform, provision the Kubernetes cluster to run alongside the manually provisioned cluster
5. Once you verify the Terraform created cluster is working as intended, tear down the manually provisioned cluster
6. Tear down all resources (but keep your Terraform scripts)
7. Share what you learned with your mentor!

## Questions

Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

- What is Kubernetes?
- What is a Terraform resource object?
- What is a Terraform data obect?

## Reflection

Use the following questions to reflect on what you learned with this exercise and discuss with your mentor:

- What conclusion can you share with your mentor?
- What did this exercise show you about yourself?
- If you were to mentor someone in the future, what highlights would you make sure they captured from this exercise? 
- Where do you want to go from here?
