# Exercise: Using an Accessibility Checker

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Learn how to use an accessibility plugin to run audits and pinpoint areas of improvement for a website's accessibility. |
| Tools/Material | An accessibility checker tool *(we recommend selecting from [IBM's Accessibility Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/))* |
| Duration | < 1 hour |

## Steps

1. Install an accessibility checker plugin in your browser from IBM's Accessibly toolkit. Here are some links to help you get started:
    - [Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ibm-equal-access-accessib/lkcagbfjnkomcinoddgooolagloogehp)
    - [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/accessibility-checker/)
2. Once the plugin is installed, go to any popular website you like to use in your browser. Try to pick something with a good amount going on within it, don't just go to the basic [google.com](http://google.com) search bar page. 
3. Now, use your new browser plugin and run an accessibility scan. 
4. Take a moment to click around and understand the report and its suggestions. 
    1. Take a screenshot or download the report for that site. 
5. Next, go to another website that you know but is not as popular. 
6. Run another scan with the accessibility plugin. 
7. Do the same thing, understand the report, and screenshot/download it. 
8. Lastly, compare and contrast the two sites and their results, noting anything interesting. 
9. Grab your mentor, and discuss your findings!  

## Reflection

- How did each website score? 
- Discuss some of the violations and ways each website could improve. 
- What conclusion can you share with your mentor?
- What surprised you about this exercise?
- Where do you want to go from here?
