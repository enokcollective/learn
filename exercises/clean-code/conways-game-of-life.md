# Exercise: Conway's Game of Life

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Build Conway's Game of Life using the four rules of simple design |
| Duration | 6-8 hours |

This exercise is heavily inspired by the [Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/the-workshop/) and is usually done as a group over a day. There is a lot of pairing involved and exploration of technical practices that you might not typically use. The goal is to have fun, take risks, and experiment with different solutions to the classic problem of "Conway's Game of Life."

## Steps

Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your best judgment, these are not precise steps):

1. Pair up with another software engineer
2. Using TDD, create a solution to Conway's Game of Life
3. Delete your code
4. Hold a group retrospective
5. Switch pairing partners
6. At the end of the day, the group gets together and shares their experiences
7. Share the results with your mentor!

## Questions

Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

- How do you better convey the intent of your code?
- What did you learn by pairing with other software engineers?
