2. Consider the potential load on your umbrella project (how much does it need to scale, and how quickly)
3. Contrast your scaling goals with your spending goals (what is your monthly budget)
4. With your scaling goals in mind, investigate how you might deploy each part to the cloud
5. Create an inventory of cloud resources that you think you might need
6. Share your findings with your mentor!
