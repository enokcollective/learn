# Exercise: Platform Identification

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Create an inventory of uncommon and common platforms (hardware, operating system, and runtime) |
| Duration | 1-2 hours |

Platform identification can help you understand the environment that your code will be running in. You can use this simple formula to construct a platform: 

```
HARDWARE + OPERATING_SYSTEM + RUNTIME = PLATFORM

iPhone 13 + iOS 15.1 + Swift 5.5
XPS 13 Laptop + Windows 11 + Chrome 96.0.4664.110
```


## Steps

Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your best judgment, these are not precise steps):

1. Find three computers in your house (e.g., Kindle, laptop, phone, etc.)
2. Using the platform formula, create a list of platforms for the three computers
3. Share the results with your mentor!

## Questions

Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

- How would you create software for each of the platforms you discovered?
- What kind of platforms are you targeting to ship your product to?

## Reflection

Use the following questions to reflect on what you learned with this exercise and discuss with your mentor:

- What conclusion can you share with your mentor?
- What surprised you about this exercise?
- Where do you want to go from here?
- What would be your next step? What resources can support you in this next step?
