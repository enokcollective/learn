# Overview

With this guide, you'll learn about EngineerKit, how it fits in the talent pipeline, and its scope, mechanics, and structure.

## Learning Map

The learning map is a visual overview of the modules and topics included in EngineerKit. [You can explore the EngineerKit learning map here](https://www.figma.com/file/fKdt0u4FidrjhQRjpXGeFQ/EngineerKit-Map?node-id=585%3A21).

## Difficulty Rating

To help an apprentice and mentor know what to expect when tackling a module, we assign a difficulty level for each module using the standard trail rating system used for outdoor activities. 

| Difficulty | Time to Complete | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%97%8F%20Easy-brightgreen?style=flat-square) | Less than a week | An "Easy" rating represents a brief overview of each topic in the module with some light skill-building |
| ![Moderate](https://img.shields.io/badge/■%20Moderate-blue?style=flat-square) | Less than two weeks | A "Moderate" rating represents a thorough overview of each topic in the module with some skill-building |
| ![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/◆%20Hard-grey?style=flat-square) | Less than a month | A "Hard" rating represents an in-depth exploration of each topic in the module with heavy skill-building |

## Umbrella Project

When you see the icon below, you'll know an exercise can fit with your umbrella project!

An "umbrella project" is used to bind together many of the exercises found in each module. It is an over-arching project that you will be working on for the duration of your apprenticeship, helping you to build your skills and ship a product to production. You'll want to pick something small that you could easily build in a week (tasklist, tic-tac-toe game, unit converter, etc.) -- you can always add more features if you have more time!
